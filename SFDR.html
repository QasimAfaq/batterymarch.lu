						<h5>Principle adverse sustainability impact statement (Article 4 SFDR)
</h5>
						<p>The AIFM recognizes the importance of incorporating sustainability principles and the adverse impacts of investment decisions. Due to the size, nature, and scale of its activities, the AIFM does not currently consider the principal adverse impacts of its investment decisions on sustainability factors. However, the AIFM will continue to monitor developments in this area and will reassess its approach as the regulatory framework evolves and practical experience increases. The AIFM is committed to reviewing its practices and considering the principal adverse impacts when the regulatory framework and market practices provide greater clarity and practicality."</p>
